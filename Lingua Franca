LINGUA FRANCA - An Offline Project
In this project, you’ll use your own computer’s command line to bring the whole course together!

Welcome to the cumulative project for the Learn Command Line course! It’s time to build fluency using the command line on your own computer. In this offline project, you will download a zip file containing all the relevant project contents. Follow the instructions below to get started and complete the project!

Objective
Lingua Franca, a translation service, has asked you to help them manage their file system and configure their environment.

Steps:
Download the lingua-franca-project.zip file.
Unzip the file by double-clicking on it in your Downloads/ folder, or wherever your downloads are.
Navigate to the newly unzipped folder, making note of its location in your computer’s file system.


TASK GROUP 1: Navigating the File System
The file structure for this project consists of language files ending in .txt grouped under various sub-directories taking the name of continents. There is a separate sub-directory called todo which also contains language files grouped under continent names.

For example, a top-level view would give you this:

africa/  asia/  europe/  northamerica/  southamerica/  spanish.txt  todo/
A sub-directory view would give you this:

./asia:
arabic.txt  hebrew.txt  hindi.txt  japanese.txt  korean.txt  malay.txt
The todo sub-directory view would appear like this:

./todo:
africa/  asia/  europe/

Task 1
Navigate to the lingua-franca/ project directory in your own file system.
cd lingua-franca

Task 2
Print the working directory.
pwd

Task 3
List the content of the current working directory.
ls

Task 4
Make a new directory, world, in the current directory.
mkdir world

Task 5
Create a new file, esperanto.txt in the world directory and list the content of the world directory.
touch world/esperanto.txt
ls world - to list the contents of the 

TASK GROUP 2: Viewing and Changing the File System

Task 6
List all the contents of the current working directory based on the following constraints:

content must include hidden files and directories
ls -a
content must appear in long format
ls -l
content must be sorted based on the time they were last modified.
ls -t
Which directory would appear first?
ls -alt 
since the world directory is the most recent addition, it will apear first in the listing 

Task 7
List the content of the europe directory. Notice that a file, chinese.txt doesn't belong there. Move that file to the currect directory, asia.
ls europe 
mv europe/chinese.txt asia

Task 8
List the current working directory. Notice that the file spanish.txt needs to be categorized somewhere. Copy it to the following directories: europe, northamerica, and southamerica. Then remove it from the current directory.
ls
cp spanish.txt europe
cp spanish.txt northamerica
cp spanish.txt southamerica
rm spanish.txt

Task 9
A directory called todo contains subdirectories of continents with language files in them. List the contents of the directory, todo/*.
ls todo/*

Task 10
Please copy these files to their appropriate locations under the current top-level directory.
cp todo/africa/* africa
cp todo/europe/* europe
cp todo/asia/* asia

Task 11
Then remove all the files and directories of todo/ excluding the todo directory in one step.
rm todo/*

TASK GROUP 3: Redirecting Input and Output

Task 12
List all the files in the asia/ directory and save it in a file, asian_language_files.txt in the todo/ directory.
ls asia/* > todo/asian_language_files.txt

Task 13
Instead of writing the contents of a file with a file editor, echo the following statement, Welkom by die Lingua Franca vertaaldienste. into the file afrikaans.txt in 
the africa directory.
echo "Welkom by die Lingua Franca vertaaldienste." > africa/afrikaans.txt
cat africa/afrikaans.txt
should output: Welkom by die Lingua Franca vertaaldienste.

Task 14
Some of the files in our project which end with the suffix, .txt, have no content in them. List the files, across all the continent directories, that end with .txt that 
have no content and save the listing in a file, empty_files.txt, in the todo/ directory.
wc -l */*.txt
wc -l */*.txt | grep 0
wc -l */*.txt | grep 0 > todo/empty_files.txt

Task 15
Display the content of todo/empty_files.txt to list all the empty files across all the continent directories.
cat todo/empty_files.txt

Task 16
The name of our translation service is Lingua Franca, however some of the files mistakenly spell it as Lingua-Franca. Replace the string 'Lingua-Franca' with 'Lingua Franca' 
in all occurrences in all the .txt files.
sed 's/Lingua-Franca/Lingua France/g' */*.txt

Check your work using this command, confirming that there are 0 occurrences of Lingua-Franca across all text files:

grep -Rl 'Lingua-Franca' */*.txt | wc -l
should output o results 

TASK GROUP 4: Configuring the Environment

Task 17
Create and open the bash profile with your favorite editor.
nano ~/.bash_profile

Task 18
In the bash profile, add a greeting of your choice. Save the bash profile, exit nano, and clear the terminal window.
echo "Welcome, Hola, Bonjour, and Buna! Welcome to our translation services"
CTRL + O, Enter, CTRL + X, Enter

Task 19
Source the bash profile to make the greeting available in the current session. You should see the greeting you creating in the above step.
source ~/.bash_profile

Task 20
Open the bash profile, and create three aliases:

md for the mkdir command
d for date
hy for history
Save the bash profile, exit nano, and clear the terminal window.

nano ~/.bash_profile
alias = md="mkdir"
alias d="date"
alias hy="hystory"
CTRL + O, Enter, CTRL + X, Enter
clear

Task 21
Source the bash profile to make the aliases available in the current session.
source ~/.bash_profile

Task 22
Test out the aliases you created for the mkdir, date, and history commands. (Recall that when you test out the alias for mkdir you will need to pass in a directory 
name as an argument such as translations.) After testing out the mkdir alias, list the directory created.

md translations 
ls translations
d to test tha alias date at the terminal 
Sun Nov 21 16:57:35 GMTST 2021
hy

Task 23
Open the bash profile. Create and export the PS1 environment variable, setting it equal to a prompt of your choice. Be sure to leave a space before the close of the quotations.
nano ~/.bash_profile
export PS1="Lingua Franca > "

Save the bash profile, exit nano, and clear the terminal window.

Task 24
Source the bash profile to make the new prompt available in the current session.
source ~/.bash_profile

Task 25
Test out the prompt by typing the names of the aliases you created. Remember to list the directory created from the mkdir alias.

md script
d
hy

Task 26
Last, but not least, return a list of environment variables.
env
